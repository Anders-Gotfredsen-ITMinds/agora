## Purpose

This is meant as a repo for sharing generally applicable knowledge. So far, I imagine the following categories:

- [Code Quality] links to articles and videos discussing code quality.
- [Linting] example lint configurations, so you have a starting point for a new project.
- [Tools] Different useful tools.

But I'm sure there can be many more; maybe you have a script or set of commands you always use; maybe you have a good description of a specific language or framework. Feel free to add whatever you find useful and make a pull request.
